<h2>Key Observations</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Deep Industries Limited:</strong> The company is on track with most of its promises, particularly in refurbishing the barge "Prabha" and exploring PSV opportunities. However, the hydrogen business exploration appears to be deprioritized.</li>
    <li><strong>Shakti Pumps (India) Limited:</strong> The company delivered strong results in Q3 FY2024, with significant progress in executing KUSUM orders, improving margins, and advancing its EV business. The focus on R&D and patents further strengthens its position in the solar pump and EV markets.</li>
